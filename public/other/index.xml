1. Transactional Systems (largely modelled using 3NF (3rd Normal Form))
Transactional systems are systems in which message flows are used to accomplish results. Examples of transactional systems would include a banking system, a recept system at a supermarket or a messaging application.

      <description>HUMS-Enabled Equipment Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) is a generic term given to data collection and analysis activities that are used to help ensure the availability, reliability and safety of vehicles.
A number of vehicle fleets (e.g M113, some tanks and G-wagons - soon Bushmasters) are equipped with sensors that feed into the CAN bus (Controller Area Network). A HUMS device sits in front of the CAN bus, duplicating the information required from the data stream.</description>
